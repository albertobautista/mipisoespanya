What we valued most was their helpfulness and approachability: they answered all our questions immediately, supported us every step of the way with the real estate agencies, and even personally handed over the keys to the apartment the day we arrived from the airport. Their service was fabulous; they were always attentive, patient, and willing to help beyond our expectations. Today we live in the place we've always wanted, and it's all thanks to them.
