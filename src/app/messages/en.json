While many of my classmates spent months trying to find a place and navigate how the system works here, thanks to Ana and Paloma we found our ideal home quickly and easily. Throughout the entire process, we felt supported and accompanied during what was a huge life transition for us (and for our dog!). We truly couldn’t be more grateful."

From the very first moment, they gave us their full support in finding the ideal apartment and went out of their way to show us the best options. They secured appointments for us immediately, and thanks to their dedication, we were able to close on our dream apartment here in Barcelona: with a terrace, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and fulfilling every single one of our needs. What we valued most was their helpfulness and approachability: they answered all our questions immediately, supported us every step of the way with the real estate agencies, and even personally handed over the keys to the apartment the day we arrived from the airport. Their service was fabulous; they were always attentive, patient, and willing to help beyond our expectations. Today we live in the place we've always wanted, and it's all thanks to them. We definitely recommend their service: every penny invested was completely worth it."

        "question": "Are you a real estate company?",
        "answer": "No, we’re a relocation agency that specializes in helping people find housing in Madrid and Barcelona.We work closely with several real estate agencies to offer our clients a wide selection of verified properties."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "What’s the difference between a short-term and a long-term apartment?",
        "answer": "A short-term apartment is rented for a few months (usually between 1 and 11), though it can match the length of your studies. It normally comes fully furnished—perfect for study or work stays. A long-term apartment, on the other hand, is usually unfurnished and rented with a standard residential contract lasting between 3 and 5 years."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "What do I need to apply for a short-term apartment?",
        "answer": "To rent a short-term apartment, it’s very important to prove the length of your stay. Usually, you’ll need to provide an acceptance letter from your university or school showing your study dates, or an employment letter stating how long you’ll be working in Spain."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "What do I need to rent an apartment?",
        "answer": "For short-term rentals, you’ll typically need: Your passport and your guarantor’s (if applicable), your student ID or acceptance letter from your school or university, proof of income, such as recent bank statements, a letter of introduction and additional documents may be requested by the real estate agency if necessary."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "What payments are required?",
        "answer": "You’ll usually need to pay: Two months’ deposit (security deposit), agency fee (equivalent to one month’s rent + VAT, or 10% of the annual rent + VAT), first month’s rent and ITP tax and utilities."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Can the agency fee be avoided?",
        "answer": "Agency fees are a standard part of the rental process and must be covered by the tenant. Only in rare cases—when there’s a direct agreement with the property owner—can these fees be avoided, although such options are very uncommon."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "Is your service only for students?",
        "answer": "Our service supports anyone moving to Spain, whether for studies or professional reasons, and we also work directly with companies relocating their employees."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "What does your service include?",
        "answer": "Our service includes comprehensive support throughout the entire relocation process. We carry out a fully personalized housing search and personally visit each property to ensure it is real, safe, and meets our quality standards. We work exclusively with 100% verified properties. We negotiate directly with real estate agencies, present all required documentation on your behalf, and manage the entire rental process from the first contact to the contract signing.
